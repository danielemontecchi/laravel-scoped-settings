# API Reference

This section describes the core methods available through the `SettingsManager` class, accessible via the `setting()` helper or the `Setting` facade.

---

## `set(string $key, mixed $value): void`

Sets a setting value.

```php
setting()->set('app.locale', 'en');
```

The `$value` can be a string, boolean, number, or array.

---

## `get(string $key, mixed $default = null): mixed`

Gets a setting value. If not found, returns the `$default`.

```php
$value = setting()->get('app.locale', 'en');
```

---

## `forget(string $key): void`

Deletes a specific setting.

```php
setting()->forget('app.locale');
```

---

## `has(string $key): bool`

Checks whether a key has been explicitly set in the current scope.

Returns `true` only if the setting exists in storage, not if a fallback is used.

```php
if (setting()->has('ui.theme')) {
    // the setting exists
}

---

## `all(): array`

Returns all settings as a flattened array (including group + key):

```php
[
  "site.name" => "My App",
  "ui.theme" => "dark"
]
```

---

## `group(string $group): array`

Returns all settings within a given group:

```php
setting()->group('ui');
// ['theme' => 'dark']
```

---

## `for(Model $model): SettingsManager`

Scopes the manager to a specific Eloquent model.

```php
setting()->for($user)->set('locale', 'it');
```

---

## `forGlobal(): SettingsManager`

Resets the manager to the global scope explicitly.

```php
setting()->forGlobal()->get('site.name');
```

---

## `clearScope(): SettingsManager`

Clears the current scope from the instance.

```php
setting()->for($user)->clearScope()->get('site.name');
```

---

## ğŸ’¡ Notes

- All keys are parsed as `group.key` internally  
- Setting values are serialized as JSON  
- Scoped values are isolated from global ones
